# Medical Data Visualizer

This is my forked version of the *Medical Data Visualizer* project, which is part of the "Data Analysis with Python" course on FreeCodeCamp.com. This version contains my additions to the primary python file medical_data_visualizer.py. Once I can run this project and pass the unit tests, I'll be submitting it for review so I can complete the course.
